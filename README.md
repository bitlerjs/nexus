# Nexus: The Open Source AI Agent Building Platform for Rapid Experimentation

Developer-friendly, open-source platform for experimenting with AI agents using task-based building blocks and OpenAPI integrations.

---

**Empower your team to rapidly experiment and build AI agents on top of your existing tools with Nexus.**

Nexus is an open-source platform designed to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI agent technology and your company's existing infrastructure. Built for developers and product managers alike, Nexus provides a streamlined environment to explore, prototype, and deploy AI agents for various internal and external use cases.

**Key Features of Nexus:**

- **Task-Based Agent Building:** Compose agents using reusable "Tasks," small units of work that can be anything from interacting with your internal APIs to complex data processing.
- **OpenAPI Integration:** Seamlessly integrate your existing services and tools by importing their OpenAPI specifications. Turn any API endpoint into a reusable Nexus Task.
- **Nexus Studio - Visual Experimentation:** Engage in interactive conversations with LLMs in Nexus Studio. Dynamically select available Tasks, tweak system prompts, and experiment with different models to find the perfect agent configuration.
- **Production-Ready Foundation:** Nexus is built with production in mind. Once you've validated an agent configuration in Nexus Studio, it can be easily deployed and integrated into your existing products.
- **OpenAPI Task Exposure:** All Tasks within Nexus are exposed via OpenAPI. They are not just for agents, but become reusable building blocks for your broader product ecosystem.
- **Developer-First Experience:** Benefit from a strongly typed TypeScript and React library for effortless programmatic interaction with the Nexus server. Build custom frontends or integrate Nexus Tasks directly into your applications.
- **Dockerized for Quick Setup:** Get Nexus up and running in minutes with our Docker setup. Start experimenting with Nexus Studio right away.

**Why Nexus?**

Many companies are exploring the potential of AI agents, but often face challenges in:

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly testing and iterating on different agent ideas.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Connecting agents to their current tools and APIs.
- **Bridging the Gap:** Making AI agent technology accessible to both developers and product-focused teams.
- **Production Readiness:** Ensuring that experimental agents can be reliably deployed when a valuable use case is found.

Nexus addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly, flexible, and production-oriented platform for AI agent experimentation and development. It's not meant to be a complete AI solution, but a powerful tool for **discovery and rapid iteration.**
